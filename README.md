# trajectory_planning_with_QP
This is a record about trajectory planning completed in ZJUT by LiuLihong.

Please run the 'RunMe.m' to execute the project!

In this case, a A* path will be generated first in the grid map. And then optimized and fit using Bezier curves. You can also use the MPC controller to track the above trajectory, but this work still has some imperfections and needs to be improved.
